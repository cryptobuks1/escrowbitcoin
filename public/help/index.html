				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What is Escrow?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>An escrow is a financial arrangement where a third party holds and regulates payment of the funds required for two parties involved in a given transaction. It helps make transactions more secure by keeping the payment in a secure escrow account which is only released when all the terms of an agreement are met as overseen by the escrow company.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What are Bitcoins?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency. It is a decentralized digital currency without a central bank or single administrator that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries. Transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Why should I use escrow?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>An escrow service is especially needed when making payments, buying things online, doing bitcoin exchanges on forums and similar. Since bitcoin transactions are irreversible many use escrow services. The bitcoin escrow service acts as a neutral third party between buyer and seller when doing business online.
It works by safely keeping your funds in a deposit account to protect both the buyer and the seller. The money is placed in the control of an independent third party. This makes transactions more secure by keeping the payment safe until all the terms have been met.</p>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How does EscrowBitcoin.net work?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>
		Buyer or Seller create transaction with details. Email with login information is sent to both parties. Buyer must login into Dashboard to deposit Bitcoins.<br><br>
    If Seller complete terms of the deal - Once seller complete the deal, buyer can complete the transaction and Bitcoins are sent to Seller's bitcoin address.<br><br>
    If Seller fails to complete the deal - Buyer can start a dispute and our support will look into the deal to decide. If seller violated the agreement, money will be refunded to buyer.
</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What happen if buyer doesn't deposit Bitcoins?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>If transaction is not funded, seller shouldn't do anything. We can only protect seller, if transaction is already paid. Unpaid transactions will be closed after 30 days.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What happened if buyer doesn't complete the transaction?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>If seller completed his part of the deal, but buyer didn't complete the transaction, seller should contact our support. Transactions are auto-completed after 30 days, so seller will get his money.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What happen if transaction is not paid in full?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>If transaction is only partial paid, Bitcoins will be refunded after 30 days. If amount is paid if full later, transaction will be auto-completed in 30 days since full payment.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

		<li>
			<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">I paid but status is still UNPAID?</a>
			<div class="cd-faq-content">
				<p>First, make sure that you paid full amount (amount + fee). If you did, check how many confirmations does your transaction have. It must have 6+ confirmations to be confirmed by our system. You can see number of confirmations on <a class='underlineHover' href='https://btc.com/'>BTC.com</a> block explorer. If your transaction is confirmed, but you still see UNPAID status, there might be problem with our Bitcoin node. Sometimes it might have some latency. If you still have problem after few hours, contact our support <a class='underlineHover' href='mailto:support@escrowbitcoin.net'>support@escrowbitcoin.net</a>.</p>

		<li>
			<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Do you accept any other cryptocurrency?</a>
			<div class="cd-faq-content">
				<p>Currenty, we accept only Bitcoin, but our developers are working hard to add more different coins and tokens to our escrow. Our plan is to add Ethereum in September, Litecoin and Steem in October, Bitcoin Cash in November and Monero in December.</p>
