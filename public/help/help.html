				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>An escrow is a financial arrangement where a third party holds and regulates payment of the funds required for two parties involved in a given transaction. It helps make transactions more secure by keeping the payment in a secure escrow account which is only released when all of the terms of an agreement are met as overseen by the escrow company.</p>

			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What are Bitcoins?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency. It is a decentralized digital currency without a central bank or single administrator that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries. Transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Why should I use escrow?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>An escrow service is especially needed when making payments, buying things online, doing bitcoin exchanges on forums and similar. Since bitcoin transactions are irreversible many use escrow services. The bitcoin escrow service acts as a neutral third party between buyer and seller when doing business online.
It works by safely keeping your funds in a deposit account to protect both the buyer and the seller. The money is placed in the control of an independent third party. This makes transactions more secure by keeping the payment safe until all the terms have been met.</p>

				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>
		Buyer or Seller create transaction with details. Email with login information is sent to both parties. Buyer must login into Dashboard to deposit Bitcoins.<br><br>
    If Seller complete terms of the deal - Once seller complete the deal, buyer can complete the transaction and Bitcoins are sent to Seller's bitcoin address.<br><br>
    If Seller fails to complete the deal - Buyer can start a dispute and our support will look into the deal to decide. If seller violated the agreement, money will be refunded to buyer.
